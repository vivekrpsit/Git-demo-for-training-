Hi guys i'm using msysgit in Window 7. How do i invoke notepad++ from Git Bash like we do it with our default notepad. Like for example

name@usename notepad textfile.txt

Instead i want the file to open with notepad++

Note : I've added notepad++ to my PATH, but still unable to invoke it from commandline.

Edit

I tried this in .gitconfig -->
